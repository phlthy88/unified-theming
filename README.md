## Project Overview

Unified Theming is a comprehensive solution for applying consistent themes across GTK, Qt, and containerized applications on Linux. The project simplifies the complex task of theming Linux desktop applications by providing a unified interface to theme multiple GUI toolkits and application packaging formats (Flatpak, Snap).

## Features
- âœ… **GTK 2/3/4 & Libadwaita:** Native theming via GSettings and CSS injection
- âœ… **Enhanced Libadwaita:** Automatic detection of LibAdapta (Linux Mint) and Zorin OS patches for 95% theming coverage
- âœ… **Qt 5/6:** kdeglobals generation with semantic color translation
- âœ… **Containerized Apps:** Full support for Flatpak applications
- âœ… **CLI Interface:** Full-featured command-line interface with Click
- âœ… **Safety Features:** Automatic backup, rollback, validation, and graceful degradation
- ðŸš§ **GUI Interface:** Modern GTK4/Libadwaita interface (Phase 3 - planned)

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **GUI Framework:** GTK4 + Libadwaita (for future GUI implementation)
- **CLI Framework:** Click
- **Testing:** pytest
- **Type Checking:** mypy
- **Linting:** flake8, black
- **Build System:** setuptools

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/phlthy88/unified-theming.git
cd unified-theming

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

## Usage

```bash
# List available themes
unified-theming list

# Apply a theme to all toolkits
unified-theming apply Adwaita-dark

# Apply to specific targets
unified-theming apply Nord --targets gtk4 --targets flatpak

# Show currently applied themes
unified-theming current

# Validate a theme's compatibility
unified-theming validate Dracula

# Rollback to previous configuration
unified-theming rollback

# List available backups
unified-theming rollback --list-backups
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 37+, or equivalent)
- Python 3.10 or higher
- GTK 4.10+ development files
- Git

### Quick Start for Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/phlthy88/unified-theming.git
cd unified-theming

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"

# Run tests to verify setup
pytest

# Run linting checks
black --check unified_theming/
flake8 unified_theming/
mypy unified_theming/
```

## Project Status

### Current Phase: Phase 2 - Core Engineering (70% Complete)
- âœ… **Week 1:** Foundation & Architecture (100%)
- âœ… **Week 2:** Core Module Testing (100%)
  - Color utilities: 86% coverage
  - Theme manager: 93% coverage
  - Configuration: 78% coverage
  - Flatpak handler: 100% coverage
- ðŸš§ **Week 3:** Integration Testing (In Progress)
  - Integration tests: 100% coverage
