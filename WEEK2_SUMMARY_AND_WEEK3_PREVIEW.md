## üö® Critical Path for Week 3

### Must Complete (P0 - Blocking)

1. **Week 2 Day 5:** Flatpak handler 75% coverage
2. **Week 3 Day 1-2:** Integration tests (validates all handlers work together)
3. **Week 3 Day 3:** CLI testing (80% coverage)
4. **Week 3 Day 4:** GTK handler testing (42% ‚Üí 70%)
5. **Week 3 Day 4-5:** Qt handler testing (24% ‚Üí 85%)

### Should Complete (P1 - Important)

1. Config.py: 75% ‚Üí 80%
2. Parser.py: 63% ‚Üí 70%
3. Performance benchmarks established
4. Stress tests implemented

### Nice to Have (P2 - Bonus)

1. Color.py: 86% ‚Üí 90%
2. Manager.py: 93% ‚Üí 95%
3. Snap handler: 76% ‚Üí 80%
4. GUI stub tests (preparation for Week 4)

## üìä Realistic Week 3 Coverage Projection

### Conservative Estimate (Minimum Viable)
```
Day 1-2 Integration: +3% (validates workflows, adds ~50 lines)
Day 3 CLI Testing:   +8% (large module, 0% ‚Üí 80%)
Day 4 Performance:   +2% (mostly validation, some new code)
Day 5 Handler Push:  +15% (focused GTK/Qt testing)

Total Week 3 Gain: +28%
End of Week 3: 44% + 28% = 72%

Gap from 80% target: -8%
Assessment: Below target, need extra effort
```

### Optimistic Estimate (With Strong Execution)
```
Day 1-2 Integration: +5% (comprehensive workflows)
Day 3 CLI Testing:   +10% (including error paths)
Day 4 Performance:   +3% (stress test code paths)
Day 5 Handler Push:  +20% (aggressive GTK/Qt testing)

Total Week 3 Gain: +38%
End of Week 3: 44% + 38% = 82%

Gap from 80% target: +2%
Assessment: Exceeds target ‚úÖ
```

### Most Likely Outcome
```
Projected Week 3 End: 75-78%
Gap from 80%: -2% to -5%

Action Required:
- Extra 0.5-1 day of targeted testing
- Focus on handler edge cases
- Quick wins in parser/config modules
```

## üîÆ Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Requires Mitigation)

**Risk 1: Qt Handler Complexity**
- **Current:** 24% coverage
- **Target:** 85% coverage (+61%)
- **Challenge:** Qt has complex kdeglobals + Kvantum dual-path
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start Qt testing early (Week 3 Day 4)
  - Focus on kdeglobals first (simpler)
  - Defer Kvantum to stretch goal
  - Acceptable to hit 70% (not 85%) if time runs out

**Risk 2: Coverage Gap (36% ‚Üí 80%)**
- **Current:** 44%
- **Target:** 80%
- **Time:** 5 days (Week 3)
- **Required Pace:** 7.2% per day
- **Assessment:** Challenging but achievable with focus

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize P0 modules (Flatpak, CLI, GTK, Qt)
- Integration tests add coverage quickly (validate workflows)
- CLI testing high-impact (large module, 0% baseline)
- Final day dedicated to gap closure

### Medium Risk (Monitor)

**Risk 3: Integration Test Complexity**
- **Challenge:** Integration tests require real theme files, multi-handler coordination
- **Impact:** May take longer than 2 days
- **Mitigation:** Start simple (happy path), add edge cases as time permits

**Risk 4: Performance Test Infrastructure**
- **Challenge:** Need performance test harness, benchmark baselines
- **Impact:** Day 4 may overrun
- **Mitigation:** Focus on critical benchmarks (theme discovery, application), defer stress tests if needed

### Low Risk (Acceptable)

**Risk 5: Missing 80% Target by 2-5%**
- **Scenario:** End Week 3 at 75-78% coverage
- **Impact:** Low - still validates critical paths
- **Acceptance Criteria:** >70% coverage acceptable for Phase 3 (GUI) start

---

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### For Week 2 Day 5 (Tomorrow)

1. **Focus on Flatpak core functionality**
   - Override file creation (most important)
   - Theme variable mapping
   - Defer portal detection if time runs out (lower priority)

2. **Keep v0.5.0 release simple**
   - CLI tests: 5 basic commands (don't overdo it)
   - Release notes: Highlight achievements + limitations
   - Tag and document quickly

3. **Don't overoptimize**
   - 75% Flatpak coverage is enough (don't aim for 90%)
   - Move to Week 3 once Day 5 criteria met

### For Week 3 Start

1. **Monday Morning: Gap Analysis**
   - Run full coverage report
   - Identify top 5 modules <70%
   - Prioritize testing order

2. **Integration Tests: Start Simple**
   - Day 1: Happy path (theme discovery ‚Üí application)
   - Day 2: Error paths (handler failures, rollback)
   - Don't get bogged down in edge cases

3. **CLI Testing: High Impact**
   - Day 3: Focus on core commands (list, apply, current)
   - Quick wins: help text, version, invalid args
   - Defer advanced features (preview, validate) if tight on time

4. **Final Push: Handlers**
   - Day 4-5: GTK (42% ‚Üí 70%) and Qt (24% ‚Üí 70%+)
   - Focus on critical paths, not 100% coverage
   - Accept 65-70% if time runs out (still validates functionality)
