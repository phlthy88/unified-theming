# Week 2 Day 3: Manager Testing

**Objective:** Implement and test `ThemeManager` in `unified_theming/core/manager.py`.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement core functions: `load_theme()`, `validate_theme()`, `apply_theme()`, `get_theme_info()`.
2. Create `tests/test_manager.py` with 50+ tests covering initialization, loading, validation, application, and errors.
3. Achieve â‰¥85% coverage for manager.py.
4. Use fixtures from `tests/fixtures/` and mock dependencies.

**Guidelines:** Follow code style, add type hints and docstrings. Run tests and generate coverage.

**Success:** Pass rate â‰¥95%, no critical bugs. Handoff to Opencode AI for QA.
